# CoworkingIllini

A mobile-first platform designed to connect University of Illinois students with compatible study partners in a **safe**, **anonymous**, and **moderated** environment.

## 📚 Project Overview

In today's demanding academic landscape, effective study practices are crucial not only for academic success but also for career readiness. Research consistently demonstrates that group study offers:

- Increased motivation
- Enhanced comprehension
- Improved time management

However, forming effective study groups presents significant challenges — especially for new students who lack connections, or for those concerned about safety when reaching out to strangers.

**CoworkingIllini** aims to solve this by offering a secure, student-only platform that enables meaningful academic collaboration, without exposing sensitive personal information.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Verified Access**: Only University of Illinois students can sign up using their Illini Email ID (SSO authentication).
- **Anonymous Matching**: Connect with peers based on study needs, enrolled courses, learning styles, and academic goals — without revealing full personal information initially.
- **Moderated Chats**: Interactions are monitored to ensure respectful and safe communication; inappropriate behavior is filtered and flagged.
- **Flexible Connections**: After comfortable anonymous interactions, users are suggested safe external tools to arrange study sessions virtually or in person.
- **Privacy First**: Only basic non-sensitive information (age, gender, major) is visible during initial interactions. No external sharing of private details.
